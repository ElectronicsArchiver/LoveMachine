# Contributing

Everybody is welcome to add new stuff to this project, only a few things to keep in mind.

## Code Style

Use Visual Studio's Code Cleanup tool with the following profile:

|Included fixers|
|--------------|
|Format document|
|Sort usings|
|Remove unnecessary usings|
|Remove unnecessary casts|
|Add accessibility modifiers|
|Sort accessibility modifiers|
|Make private fields readonly when possible|

## Document your changes

Edit `doc/README.md` to reflect your changes if necessary.

Do not edit the `.github/README.md` file! That file is updated automatically after each release.


## Contributing
PRs for onboarding new games are welcome. The process is relatively simple and requires barely any coding. See the PlayHome implementation for reference. PRs for supporting new device types are also welcome.

This mod is provided free of charge, but I do accept donations. If you'd like to boost my morale, please check me out on [Patreon].
